## Git Assignment
We agree to use the course deadline (Friday 23th February).
It's up to every one of us to do it.
Remind each other about finishing it before the deadline. (On Thursday)

## Code of Conduct
We need to add an explanation to the team values in the code of conduct. Explain why we chose these values and why they are important to us.
If you have an idea for a team value just add it to the google docs. We'll let the ideas develop naturally.
*The deadline for the first draft of the code of conduct is Thursday.*
We will finalize it after the next meeting.
