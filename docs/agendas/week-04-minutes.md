## Agenda
No addition to be added to the Agenda

## Problem with main repository
Razvan pushed changes to main on main branch and not on a branch so overwritten of files already on main.
Old files were modified

The pipeline passed

* TA fix:
There is not really a way to fix it
Always accept your own changes
We should have had a merge conflict but we did not have one
Never work on main
You will get negative points if the TA git resets (we did not chose to take it)


## Problem insufficient mail contribution
If you think it is wrong you have to send e-mail to the lecturers 
You can not fail 2 consectutive weeks
At the end of the project you need have passed the basic requirement overall (so basically the 700 lines total, 21 commits etc.)


## Buddy check
Deadline of Buddy Check: 8-03-2024, just complete it individually


## Code of Conduct
We submitted before the deadline and passed with a grade of 8.6 (Very Good)
Planning is the only topic that is sufficient (so we can improve it if we want to)


## Completed tasks

**Front-end team**
* Naman: Code cleanup, back button added in most GUI and created skeleton code GUI add/edit button
* Amin: Created the event Overview GUI
* Mihai: Skeleton of language button GUI (more cumbersone than expected)


**Back-end team**
* Razvan: Basic algorithm debts, in the class openDebts reformatting data
* Stanislaw: Added endpoints, JSON dump (admin option)
* Vasil: Not present

## The State of the Project

Basics requirements almost completed

**Front-end**
* Most of the GUI is done except 2 GUI's and the GUI's made have to be tweaked a little and be connected to the backend

**Back-end**
* Only a small web config websockets files (websockets has to be completed still)
* Debts: settle debts class is close to completion (all people can contribute in an expense)


## Tasks for Next Week
Having a working prototype with all the basic requirements after this week or at last after the midterm


**Back-end**
* Try to get the Websockets completed (deadline by thursday) 500 lines of code estimate
* Setup controller for debts (? lines)


**Front-end**
* Language button estimate (100 lines of code)
* Completing GUI add/edit (100 lines or less)
* Creating GUI create event and admin page (? lines)

* Overlapping task
